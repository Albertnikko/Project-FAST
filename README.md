Form Automation System Tunnel (Project FAST) 



These google sheets serve as database for students learning progress, also known as quarterly grades. 

Through this, teachers can easily input students' grades
thereby enabling class advisers to have an automated electronic student report card by just typing the student's name under the E-Card Sheet


NOTE : All names here were changed to random names to protect the identities of the student.
